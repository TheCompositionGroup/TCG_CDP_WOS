# Concept Development Package

**Warehouse Operating System (WOS)**
*Working title. The system is unbuilt and the name carries no established meaning.*

| Field | Entry |
|---|---|
| Project code | TCG-CDP-RETAIL-001 |
| Prepared by | Rob Knowles, Project Director — The Composition Group LLC |
| Client | Regional warehouse-direct retailer (single location, southeastern U.S.) |
| Initial white paper | 26 April 2026 |
| Revision | Revision D — Controlled, 17 August 2026 |
| Portfolio Edition | Public-release generalization, [DATE] |
| Pilot location | Pilot warehouse |
| Status | On-spec concept / build status unverified / Gate A not open |

**PURPOSE.** Define what should be built, what must be tested in the pilot, what evidence is needed to justify expansion, and which questions must be resolved before any broader licensing claim is made.

---

# Document Control & Evidence Standard

This package combines the operating concept, proposed software architecture, local deployment roadmap, validation plan, and scale strategy into one working baseline. It is a concept-development document — not a claim that the system, performance improvements, or expansion opportunity have already been verified.

| Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Known / supplied | Information provided by the project owner or local operator; still subject to confirmation where noted. |
| Design decision | A proposed choice that can be changed during build or stakeholder review. |
| Hypothesis | A measurable belief that the pilot must test. |
| Target | A desired performance level, not a current result. |
| Unknown / verify | Information required before launch, contracting, or scale. |

**CURRENT DECISION.** Authorize a narrowly scoped local pilot only after owner workflow, data ownership, messaging consent, attribution rules, and success metrics are confirmed. Productization beyond the pilot site remains conditional on local evidence.

## Development methodology

This CDP applies a hybrid DMADV/DMAIC development structure. DMADV governs definition, measurement, architecture, design, and pre-deployment verification of the proposed system. DMAIC governs baseline assessment of the existing manual workflow and any subsequent pilot improvement. The TCG operating loop — CREATE → VERIFY → TEST → REFINE — connects both methods, while client verification gates separate proposed design choices from accepted operational requirements.

| Class | Source type | Use |
|---|---|---|
| P | Primary evidence | System record, contract, source code, provider console, direct observation, or measured test. |
| S | Secondary evidence | Authoritative external documentation or current reference material. |
| A | Assumption / design proposal | Architecture or operating choice awaiting verification. |
| X | Client/project-supplied, unverified | Statement or marketing claim supplied to the project but not independently confirmed. |
| V | Verified through controlled test | Requirement or claim supported by recorded pass/fail evidence. |

## Author interest and independence limits

The Composition Group LLC prepared this package and is also the proposed builder, the proposed owner of the core application code (Section 10), and the proposed recipient of pilot compensation. TCG therefore holds a commercial interest in a decision to proceed and in the measured value of the pilot.

This is disclosed rather than resolved. The reader should treat every design proposal, target, and hypothesis in this package as an interested party's recommendation, not an independent assessment.

Two controls apply. First, all Section 8 attribution and reconciliation at Gate C is performed by the store against the store's own agreed sales source of truth; TCG dashboard output is not sufficient evidence of an attributed sale. Second, the Gate C economic threshold is frozen in writing with the baseline, before launch, by both parties — not set after results are available.

*Source class: this section states a structural fact about the engagement, not a finding.*

## Revision history

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| White paper | 26 Apr 2026 | Initial Warehouse Operating System concept and scaling thesis. |
| CDP baseline | 15 Aug 2026 | Integrated problem, architecture, pilot, measurement, governance, risks, and claim controls. |

| Revision B — illustrated | 15 Aug 2026 | Standardized TCG entity naming; named hybrid DMADV/DMAIC method; added P/S/A/X/V evidence classes, preliminary FMEA, VSM, funnel, ERD, interface plates, and minor claim/gate/message corrections. |
| Illustrated CDP | 17 Aug 2026 | Integrated project build imagery and interface-development evidence; technical baseline unchanged. |
| Revision C — final illustrated | 17 Aug 2026 | Added development-artifact and source-code evidence, named Gatekeeper Turnover, elevated Action 01 live-risk control, and reconciled owner-verifiable as-built fields. |
| Revision D — controlled | 17 Aug 2026 | Added author-interest disclosure, decision sheet, §5.3 cost and schedule basis, §9.0 FMEA rubric and action thresholds, F8 residual-risk disposition and continuity control, default data retention periods, §8.3.1 sample-size estimate; elevated franchise-authority verification to Action 02 with a corresponding stop criterion; labeled the system name as a working title. Technical baseline otherwise unchanged. |
| **Portfolio Edition** | **[DATE]** | **Public-release generalization. Client identity, operator names, pilot address, brand marks, brand colors, repository identifiers, and client-specific commercial mechanics removed or generalized. Technical baseline, methodology, requirements, risk register, and gate structure unchanged.** |

## True state at issue

| Area | Controlled status |
|---|---|
| Concept | Documented. This CDP is the current concept baseline. |
| Build | Unverified. Repo, branch, commit, deployed route, integrations, and acceptance results have not been entered into configuration control. |
| Live customer risk | Unknown. First action is to verify whether any public form accepts real bookings and where submissions go. |
| Client agreement | None documented. No signed pilot scope, data agreement, commission rule, or named contracting counterparty. |
| Data | No baseline or pilot dataset has been supplied. |
| Client verification | Phase 0 workflow session with the store operators not completed. |
| Decision gates | None passed. Gate A remains closed. |

**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK.** Before any additional feature work, verify every publicly reachable booking form. A live form must either deliver submissions to a monitored destination and confirm accurately, or be disabled and labeled as a demonstration.

# Decision Sheet

**What this is.** A concept baseline for a small scheduling, inventory, and notification system for the pilot warehouse. It is a proposal and a test plan. Nothing in it has been built to a verified standard, agreed, or proven.

**What is being asked.** Not approval to launch. Approval to spend roughly one week confirming five things: how leads are actually handled today, what "in stock" can realistically mean, which sales record settles what counts as a sale, whether the client's franchise agreement permits any of this, and what the current numbers are.

**What it would cost.** See Section 5.3. Development effort is estimated at 120–180 hours. Ongoing service costs are estimated at $60–140 per month plus advertising. Fees and commercial terms are set in the separate pilot agreement, not in this package.

**What could stop it?**

| Risk | Effect if true |
|---|---|
| Franchise agreement prohibits an independent site, customer-data capture, brand use, or third-party messaging | Project ends. Resolve first. |
| Lead volume too low to prove a percentage improvement | Pilot still runs, but as a feasibility test — no statistical claim. |
| Inventory status cannot be kept current by two people | Reduce to category level or drop inventory display. |
| Text-message consent and sender registration not completed | No messaging. Confirmation email only. |

**What is needed, and when.** Section 13, Actions 01–06, within five business days of authorization. Two of those belong to the client: a 60–90 minute working session, and a legal read of the franchise agreement.

**Current status.** Gate A is closed. No agreement is signed. No customer traffic is authorized.

---

# Executive Summary

The client operates through a warehouse-direct, appointment-oriented sales model. That model keeps storefront overhead low, but it also makes the handoff from social-media interest to an attended warehouse appointment operationally critical. When the handoff depends on manual messaging, customers can wait, inventory can change, directions can be missed, and owners can spend selling time performing repetitive coordination.

The proposed Warehouse Operating System (WOS) is a mobile-first scheduling, inventory, notification, and lead-status layer. The local proof-of-concept would give customers a short path from advertisement to appointment while giving the store operators a simple control surface for inventory availability, calendar blocks, and sales outcomes. The initial system would use Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, Resend, Twilio, and managed hosting.

The immediate purpose is not to build a multi-location SaaS platform. It is to determine whether a small local system is used consistently and produces attributable improvements in response time, appointment attendance, qualified traffic, or closed sales. Only after the local workflow and economics are proven should the code be generalized for multiple stores and presented for broader licensing.

# 0. As-Built Configuration Control

This section is the controlling record of what exists. It must be completed from the repository, deployed environment, and provider consoles — not from memory. Until the fields below are populated and verified, "built," "deployed," "bilingual," "integrated," and "multi-tenant" must not be used as public claims.

| Control item | Current entry | Verification / owner |
|---|---|---|
| Repository / branch / commit | `retail-ops-prototype` / main / commit hash TBD | RK: project and active main branch evidenced in supplied development screenshot; record exact repository URL and commit hash before Gate A. |
| Deployed URL(s) | TBD — reconcile with any public route | RK: test every reachable route in production. |
| Booking destination | TBD — urgent | RK: submit a controlled test and prove receipt at a monitored destination. |
| Customer languages | Reported EN/ES capability; unverified | RK + operators: verify full content, validation, consent, STOP/help, and error-state parity. |
| Database / tenant model | Proposed Supabase with `store_id` | RK: inspect schema, migrations, RLS policies, and production data. |
| Merchant controls | Proposed / existence unverified | Operators: complete task-based acceptance on mobile. |
| Email integration | Proposed Resend | RK: identify account owner, verified sending domain, DNS status, templates, and delivery logs. |
| SMS integration | Proposed Twilio | RK: identify account owner, number type, Messaging Service, registration, consent, and callbacks. |
| Maps / financing / reviews | Reported in operating materials; unverified | Operators: approve sources, terms, as-of dates, and consumer copy. |
| Design source files | Project source includes generalized brand assets; brainstorm source supplied separately | RK: record controlled storage location and licenses before handoff. |
| Provider account owner(s) | TBD | Joint: name legal owner of record for hosting, DB, email, SMS, domain. |
| Gate status | Gate A closed | RK maintains; operators accept client-controlled entries. |

## 0.1 As-built audit method

1. Capture the current production URL and perform one controlled end-to-end booking using non-customer test data.
2. Confirm where the submission lands, what the customer sees, and whether owners receive actionable notice.
3. Record repo, branch, commit, environment, schema version, provider accounts, and domain/DNS ownership.
4. Compare the running product against every requirement in Section 6 and record pass, fail, not implemented, or not testable.
5. Disable or relabel any public feature whose backend, disclosure, inventory, or message behavior is not operationally true.

# 1. Problem

## 1.1 Operating context

The supplied client model is wholesale-to-public: project materials describe brand-new mattresses and furniture sold from a low-overhead warehouse rather than a conventional staffed showroom. Those materials report discount, warranty, inventory-speed, appointment-access, and financing claims; each remains source class X and requires current brand/provider authorization before consumer use. The pilot location serves a regional market from a warehouse-direct site.

## 1.2 Friction gap

The critical break occurs between digital intent and physical arrival. A social-media lead may ask whether an item is available, whether financing is possible, where the warehouse is, and when someone can meet them. If those questions require several manual exchanges, each exchange creates delay and drop-off risk.

| Friction | Operational effect | Pilot response |
|---|---|---|
| Manual reply delay | Buyer interest cools before a time is secured. | Immediate self-service scheduling with owner notification. |
| Changing inventory | Buyer may arrive for an item no longer available. | Simple availability status and confirmation language. |
| Appointment ghosting | Owner travels or waits without a sale. | Confirmation and timed reminder sequence. |
| Location confusion | Customer misses or cannot find the pilot suite. | Map link, address, and arrival instructions in SMS. |
| Unqualified traffic | Owner cannot prioritize urgent or finance-ready leads. | Capture product category and financing interest without discriminatory scoring. |
| Fragmented records | No clean attribution from ad to booking to sale. | Event and status tracking in one pilot database. |

> **FIGURE 1 — Current-state value stream map**
> Manual messenger-to-warehouse flow. Baseline collection strip: leads/month, median response time, unanswered %, booking rate, show-up rate, close rate, average ticket — all TBD, source class P/X.
> *Collection purpose: use messenger timestamps, owner calendar, POS/invoices, and ad records to replace assumed friction with measured wait, yield, and loss. %C&A and process-time fields are intentionally blank until Phase 0 evidence is collected.*
> *Figure 1. Source class: X/A until Phase 0 populates primary evidence (P).*

## 1.3 Problem statement

> **PROBLEM STATEMENT.** The pilot retailer needs a faster, trackable way to convert social-media interest into attended, inventory-aligned appointments without increasing administrative workload or removing owner control.

---

# 2. Idea & Value Proposition

Create a single-channel customer funnel connected to a lightweight merchant dashboard. A customer follows the pilot link, reviews current product categories or featured availability, selects a time, provides minimum necessary contact information, indicates financing interest if desired, and receives confirmation and directions. The merchant sees the appointment, manages availability, blocks times, and records the outcome.

| User | Job to be done | Promised value |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | Find a relevant product and secure a warehouse visit quickly. | Less waiting, clearer availability, immediate directions and confirmation. |
| Store operators | Control when customers arrive and what they expect to see. | Fewer repetitive messages; one-thumb inventory and calendar control. |
| The Composition Group LLC | Operate and improve a repeatable digital funnel. | Attributable pilot evidence and a reusable product architecture. |
| Future corporate stakeholder | Standardize local digital execution while preserving store-level control. | Comparable data and consistent customer experience — only if governance is accepted. |

## 2.1 Value boundaries

- The system supports selling; it does not replace owner judgment, live customer service, financing-provider disclosures, or warranty terms.
- Inventory status must be presented at the level the owners can maintain reliably. "In stock" should not imply a reserved unit unless reservation logic exists.
- Financing interest may help tailor follow-up, but it should not be labeled a "whale" score or used as an opaque eligibility decision.
- Urgency must be truthful and inventory-based. Claims such as "two left" should only appear when supported by current counts.

# 3. Concept of Operations

## 3.1 Customer flow

| Step | Customer / system action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Customer opens the pilot campaign link from a social-media advertisement or marketplace conversation. |
| 2 | Landing page establishes warehouse-direct value, location, approved condition/warranty language, delivery information, and appointment expectation. |
| 3 | Customer chooses a product category or currently promoted item, indicates financing interest if applicable, and selects an available time. |
| 4 | Customer enters minimum contact information and affirmatively consents to transactional appointment messages. |
| 5 | System creates the appointment, sends confirmation, notifies the owners, and provides the address and map link. |
| 6 | Provisional reminder rule executes. Customer arrives, reschedules, cancels, or does not appear. |
| 7 | Owner records the standardized outcome. If sold, only the minimum agreed commercial data is recorded. |

## 3.2 Merchant flow

| Step | Merchant action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Sign in through a role-controlled admin page. |
| 2 | Review upcoming appointments and lead details needed for the visit. |
| 3 | Set inventory status or category availability using a mobile-friendly control. |
| 4 | Block or reopen appointment periods for delivery, restocking, or personal availability. |
| 5 | Mark the appointment outcome promptly after the visit. |
| 6 | Review weekly funnel totals and reconcile eligible sales against the named source of truth. |

## 3.3 Exception flow

| Event | System behavior | Owner decision |
|---|---|---|
| Item sells after booking | Do not silently substitute. Flag availability change and contact customer. | Offer comparable items or allow cancellation. |
| Owner blocks a booked time | Require explicit reschedule workflow and notification. | Select alternate time; confirm customer response. |
| Customer replies to SMS | Route to monitored number or clearly state response limitations. | Define who monitors and response hours. |
| Notification fails | Log delivery status and surface failure in dashboard. | Use approved fallback contact method. |
| Duplicate booking | Detect matching contact/time where feasible. | Merge, retain, or contact customer. |
| No-show | Record status; apply approved follow-up cadence. | Decide whether and when to re-engage. |

> **FIGURE 2 — Future-state funnel**
> CAMPAIGN (source tagged) → NEED (category selected) → SLOT (availability shown) → CONSENT (affirmative + versioned) → CONFIRM (record + directions) → REMIND (provisional T−2h) → VISIT (outcome recorded) → VERIFY (reconcile + analyze).
> *Every transition emits a defined event. Every public claim waits for verified evidence.*
> *Figure 2. Source class: A; transitions become V only after controlled testing.*

# 4. Functional Design

## 4.1 Customer-facing pilot funnel

- Target route: `/retail/pilot`, subject to as-built reconciliation. Every deployed URL must be entered in Section 0 before the route is treated as controlled.
- Mobile-first, three-stage target: select need → select time → confirm details; actual interaction count must be measured before claiming "three-click booking."
- English/Spanish parity is a provisional scope item because bilingual behavior has been reported but not verified. If retained, all labels, validation, consent, confirmation, STOP/help, and error states require language parity testing.
- Client-approved primary and accent colors with white; bold sans-serif price language; delivery, warranty, and calendar iconography. *(Specific brand hex values withheld in this edition; treated as proposed palette pending written brand confirmation.)*
- Prominent location context: regional pilot market and pilot warehouse.
- Clear disclaimers for availability, pricing, warranties, financing, and messaging consent.

## 4.2 Merchant portal

- Secure login for named users; no shared plaintext password.
- Upcoming appointments with status, category interest, consent record, and notification state.
- Inventory availability controls designed for fast mobile updates.
- Calendar blackout controls with protection against silently invalidating existing bookings.
- Outcome entry: showed, no-show, canceled, rescheduled, sold, not sold.
- Audit trail for material changes to inventory, appointments, and outcomes.

## 4.3 Notification bridge

| Channel | Event | Content | Control |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email / Resend | New or changed booking | Appointment summary for owners. | Verified sending domain; owner list; failure logging. |
| SMS / Twilio | Booking confirmation | Time, address, map link, change/cancel path. | Affirmative consent; registered sender path; STOP handling. |
| SMS / Twilio | Reminder | Provisional v1: one reminder at T−2 hours. | If booked inside two hours, confirmation only; revise from evidence. |
| Dashboard | Delivery failure | Failed or undelivered message status. | Owner can follow up manually. |

- Message-count control: up to three standard transactional texts per appointment — confirmation, one reminder, and one system-triggered change/cancellation notice when applicable. Customer-initiated replies and required opt-out/help responses are logged separately.

## 4.4 Messaging readiness dependencies

- If a US 10-digit long-code sender is used, the sending business and campaign must be registered through the applicable A2P 10DLC process before Gate B. The correct legal entity and account owner must therefore be selected in Phase 0.
- The customer opt-in must be affirmative and versioned. Message purpose, expected frequency, possible carrier rates, privacy/terms links, and STOP instructions must be reviewed against provider and legal requirements before launch.
- Resend requires a verified domain. SPF and DKIM validation are part of domain verification; DMARC is a separate deliverability control to configure and verify.
- Bilingual SMS requires equivalent consent and opt-out/help behavior in both supported languages, not merely translated page labels.

# 5. Technical Architecture

**Warehouse Operating System (WOS)** *(working title; the system is unbuilt and the name carries no established meaning)*

The alpha should remain deliberately small. A single deployed application serves the pilot customer route and admin portal. Supabase provides PostgreSQL, authentication, row-level access control, and event storage. Transactional email and SMS are invoked by server-side functions; provider credentials never ship to the browser.

| Layer | Proposed technology | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Presentation | Next.js + Tailwind | Responsive customer funnel and merchant dashboard. |
| Application | Next.js server actions / API routes | Validation, booking rules, notification orchestration, attribution. |
| Data | Supabase PostgreSQL | Stores, users, inventory, appointments, events, consent, outcomes. |
| Identity | Supabase Auth | Named merchant accounts and role-based authorization. |
| Email | Resend | Transactional owner and customer email where approved. |
| SMS | Twilio | Transactional confirmations, reminders, and delivery status. |
| Hosting | Vercel or approved managed host | Deployment, environment isolation, logs, and rollback. |
| Analytics | First-party event model | Funnel analysis without unnecessary third-party tracking. |

## 5.1 Minimum data model

| Entity | Purpose | Key fields / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `stores` | Tenant and location configuration | `store_id`, display name, address, phone, timezone, settings; pilot site begins as `store_001`. |
| `merchant_users` | Authorized portal access | `user_id`, `store_id`, role, active status; identity data remains in auth provider. |
| `inventory_items` | Availability presented to customers | Provisional alpha: category-level state; optional model/SKU; exact quantity disabled unless Phase 0 confirms reliable upkeep. Includes `store_id` and `updated_at`. |
| `availability_rules` | Bookable hours and exceptions | `store_id`, day/range, capacity, blackout reason, effective dates. |
| `appointments` | Customer booking and lifecycle | `store_id`, time, contact, category interest, financing interest, consent timestamp, status. |
| `notifications` | Delivery audit | `appointment_id`, channel, template version, send time, provider status, error. |
| `lead_events` | Funnel evidence | Session/lead key, event name, timestamp, campaign source; retention per Section 10. |
| `sales_outcomes` | Pilot attribution and reconciliation | `appointment_id`, sold flag, value or commercial basis only if contract permits, `recorded_by`, `recorded_at`. |

> **FIGURE 3 — Logical data model**
> `STORES` (PK `store_id`) parents `MERCHANT_USERS`, `INVENTORY_ITEMS`, `AVAILABILITY_RULES`, `APPOINTMENTS`. `APPOINTMENTS` parents `SALES_OUTCOMES`, `NOTIFICATIONS`, `LEAD_EVENTS`.
> *Control: every business record carries `store_id` directly or through a tested appointment relationship; RLS must deny cross-store access.*
> *Figure 3. Source class: A; physical schema, foreign keys, and RLS policies remain subject to the Section 0 as-built audit.*

## 5.2 Multi-tenant boundary

The alpha may hard-code the pilot site at the route level, but all business records should still carry `store_id`. Row-level security must prevent one store from reading or changing another store's data. A later clone test is valid only after settings, users, inventory, availability, templates, and analytics filters are tenant-scoped — not merely the address shown on the page.

> **ARCHITECTURE GATE.** Do not call the system "multi-tenant SaaS" until tenant isolation has been tested, roles are defined, data retention is documented, and a second store can be provisioned without source-code changes.

## 5.3 Preliminary cost basis and schedule

Rough order of magnitude only. Provider pricing is source class S and is time-sensitive; every figure below must be re-verified against current published rates before Gate A. Effort estimates are source class A.

### 5.3.1 Development effort

| Work package | Estimated hours |
|---|---|
| Backend baseline — schema, access policies, seed | 25–35 |
| Customer funnel — booking, validation, consent, change/cancel, error states | 35–50 |
| Merchant portal — auth, appointments, inventory, blackout, outcomes, audit trail | 30–45 |
| Notification bridge — email, SMS, delivery status, failure surfacing | 15–25 |
| Acceptance testing against Section 6, merchant UAT, runbook | 15–25 |
| **Total** | **120–180** |

Estimate excludes work already performed, whose verified state is unknown pending the Section 0 as-built audit. Excludes bilingual scope, which adds an estimated 20–30 hours if retained.

### 5.3.2 Recurring service cost

| Item | Estimated monthly |
|---|---|
| Managed hosting | $20–25 |
| Database and authentication | $0–25 |
| Transactional email | $0–20 |
| SMS — messaging service, number, and per-message volume at pilot scale | $15–50 |
| Messaging campaign registration, amortized | $10–15 |
| Domain, amortized | $2 |
| **Total** | **$60–140** |

One-time messaging brand registration is additionally expected. Advertising spend is separate and is not a system cost.

### 5.3.3 Indicative schedule

Relative to authorization (Day 0), assuming a single developer and prompt client response.

| Milestone | Target |
|---|---|
| Phase 0 complete; Gate A decision | Day 5 |
| Phase 1 lab build complete | Day 25–35 |
| Acceptance and merchant UAT complete; Gate B decision | Day 35–45 |
| Baseline and pilot window | Per Section 8.3 sample requirement |
| Validation report; Gate C decision | Within 5 business days of pilot close |

**Cost basis limits.** These figures do not constitute a quotation. Fees, payment schedule, and commercial basis are established in the pilot agreement. Recurring service costs are borne by the party named in that agreement; Section 12.2 records this as unresolved.

# 6. Requirements & Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail condition |
|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Customer sees pilot location and accurate bookable schedule. | Chrome/Safari mobile + desktop tests pass; Eastern time and daylight-saving boundary test pass. |
| F-02 | Customer can create, change, or cancel an appointment. | Five scripted cases each produce one correct record, status transition, and intended notice; no orphan booking. |
| F-03 | Merchant can update inventory from a phone. | Named user changes state in ≤30 seconds; customer view updates in ≤10 seconds in five consecutive tests. |
| F-04 | Merchant can create calendar blackouts safely. | New conflicting booking is blocked; each existing conflict is surfaced and requires an explicit disposition. |
| F-05 | System sends confirmation and v1 reminder. | Immediate confirmation attempted within 60 seconds; T−2h rule executes; provider result and failure are visible. |
| F-06 | Merchant can record appointment and sales outcome. | Every change records standardized status, actor, and timestamp; invalid transitions are rejected. |
| L-01 | English/Spanish experience is equivalent if bilingual scope is retained. | All screens, validation, consent, messages, STOP/help, and error states pass paired-language script. |
| A-01 | Core flow is accessible by keyboard and assistive technology. | WCAG 2.2 AA automated scan has no critical errors; keyboard, labels, focus, contrast, and zoom tests pass. |
| S-01 | Access is restricted by named user and store role. | Anonymous/admin and cross-store read/write test matrix returns zero unauthorized successes. |
| S-02 | Secrets and customer data are not exposed client-side. | Bundle, source map, browser storage, network payload, repo scan, and logs expose no provider secret or unnecessary PII. |
| P-01 | Consent and message purpose are recorded. | Unchecked affirmative control stores exact wording/version, language, timestamp, source, and opt-out state. |
| O-01 | Pilot data can be exported for reconciliation. | Date-bounded export matches database totals and agreed sales source for a seeded 25-record test set. |
| R-01 | Application and data can be recovered. | Rollback to known-good release demonstrated within 30 minutes; backup restore drill meets provisional RPO 24h / RTO 4h. |
| N-01 | Notification failures are actionable. | Simulated provider rejection appears in dashboard/log within 5 minutes and triggers documented owner fallback. |

# 7. Local Pilot Plan

## Phase 0 — Stakeholder verification

Before code is treated as operational, conduct a short workflow session with the store operators. Confirm who answers leads, when appointments can occur, what "in stock" means, what data they will update, who owns the customer relationship, what qualifies as an attributable sale, which notifications they will monitor, and which POS/invoicing/franchise report is the sales source of truth. Review the franchise agreement for permission to operate an independent site, capture customer data, use client marks, and send third-party messages under the brand.

| Phase 0 decision | Provisional default | Who confirms |
|---|---|---|
| Legal contracting party | The Composition Group LLC; subject to contract review. | RK + authorized store entity |
| Inventory granularity | Category-level availability; no exact quantity claim. | Store operators |
| Reminder v1 | Immediate confirmation + one T−2h reminder; confirmation only inside two hours. | Store operators + provider review |
| Sales source of truth | TBD: POS, invoice system, or franchise report with dated export. | Store operators |
| Domain / sending identity | Decision pulled forward; must support verified email and messaging registration. | Joint |
| Customer data exit | Store receives on-demand export and deletion at termination, subject to lawful retention. | Pilot agreement |
| Bilingual scope | Retain only if full functional and messaging parity is accepted. | Store operators |
| Pilot objective | Quantitative lift only if baseline volume supports adequate sample; otherwise feasibility and directional evidence. | Joint after baseline |

## Phase 1 — Lab build

| Work package | Output | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Backend baseline | Stores, users, inventory, availability, appointments, notifications, events, and outcomes. | Schema reviewed; access policies tested; `store_001` seeded. |
| Customer funnel | `/retail/pilot` branded booking flow. | Mobile booking, validation, consent, change/cancel, and error states pass. |
| Merchant portal | Named login, appointments, inventory, blackout, and outcome controls. | Store operators complete defined tasks without developer assistance. |
| Notification bridge | Resend and Twilio transactional events. | Confirmation and reminder deliver; failures are logged and visible. |
| Operating baseline | Runbook, support boundary, and rollback procedure. | Owners know what to do if inventory, schedule, or messaging is wrong. |

## Phase 2 — Show-up validation

- Use a controlled campaign link with source parameters so the pilot can distinguish WOS-attributed traffic.
- Run a baseline period or preserve comparable pre-pilot data where possible. Without a baseline, improvement claims will be weak.
- Observe booking completion, time-to-appointment, reminder delivery, attendance, sale outcome, and owner usage.
- Change reminder timing only through documented test windows; avoid tuning multiple variables at once.
- Reconcile "sold" appointments against the contractually agreed source of truth, not dashboard self-report alone.

## Phase 3 — Productization test

- Move address, phone, inventory structure, operating hours, templates, theme, and policies into store settings.
- Provision a dummy second-market store with isolated users and data.
- Measure actual provisioning effort. A less-than-10-minute target is useful, but it is not sufficient by itself; isolation, support, billing, and offboarding also matter.
- Decide whether the branded domain is owned by the client entity, The Composition Group LLC, or another contracting entity, and document transfer rights.

## Phase 4 — Corporate decision package

- Prepare a case study based on actual pilot data, cohort size, pilot dates, campaign spend, and limitations.
- Demonstrate brand controls, tenant isolation, inventory freshness, appointment outcomes, and corporate/store visibility boundaries.
- Present commercial alternatives: local subscription, per-location license, corporate master agreement, managed service, or asset acquisition.

# 8. Measurement & Verification

## 8.1 Measurement principle

The pilot must distinguish activity from impact. More bookings do not necessarily mean more profitable sales, and a higher show-up rate can be misleading if only the best leads are counted. Metrics need fixed definitions, a denominator, a time window, and a documented data source.

| Metric | Definition | Source | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing conversion | Confirmed bookings ÷ unique eligible funnel sessions. | `lead_events` + `appointments` | Tests whether the funnel converts interest. |
| Booking completion | Confirmed bookings ÷ started bookings. | `lead_events` | Finds form or scheduling friction. |
| Show-up rate | Showed appointments ÷ eligible confirmed appointments. | Merchant outcome + audit | Primary operational hypothesis. |
| Qualified show-up | Attended visits meeting agreed qualification criteria. | Appointment + outcome | Separates traffic volume from fit. |
| Sales conversion | Sold appointments ÷ attended appointments. | Reconciled outcome | Connects attendance to commercial result. |
| Attributed revenue | Eligible sales value tied to WOS appointments. | Agreed sales record | Supports economics; requires reconciliation rules. |
| Owner adoption | Required records updated within agreed time. | Audit timestamps | Determines whether the data can be trusted. |
| Inventory freshness | Time since last availability update. | Inventory audit | Measures mismatch risk. |
| Notification delivery | Delivered transactional messages ÷ attempted messages. | Provider callbacks | Validates the reminder mechanism. |
| Cost per attended visit | Campaign + messaging + operating cost ÷ attended visits. | Ad spend + system data | Supports pricing and ROI discussion. |

## 8.2 Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Test | Decision use |
|---|---|---|
| Faster booking reduces abandonment. | Compare start-to-confirm completion and response time against baseline or controlled periods. | Keep, shorten, or redesign funnel. |
| A timed reminder improves attendance. | Compare defined cohorts with consistent eligibility and reminder rules. | Set reminder cadence. |
| Inventory visibility reduces mismatched visits. | Track visits affected by unavailable requested product before and during pilot. | Choose category-level vs. item-level inventory. |
| Owners will maintain the system. | Measure update completeness and interview both users. | Determine if the model is operationally viable. |
| The system creates incremental economics. | Compare attributable gross benefit with advertising, messaging, support, and development cost. | Set pricing and decide whether to scale. |

> **EXAMPLE ANALYTICS STATEMENT — DO NOT USE YET.** "At the pilot site, 80% of financing-interested leads showed within two hours of booking" is only publishable after the cohort, date range, sample size, financing-interest definition, and event timestamps are verified.

## 8.3 Baseline, sample, and proof limits

Baseline collection begins before feature expansion. First recover available history from the ad platform, page inbox, owner calendar, POS or invoices, and financing-provider reports. Then run a 2–4 week prospective baseline if historical records cannot support consistent definitions.

| Input | Source | Decision enabled |
|---|---|---|
| Leads/month, response time, unanswered inquiries | Ad platform + inbox timestamps | Quantifies the real response leak and available sample. |
| Bookings, shows, no-shows, reschedules | Owner calendar / controlled baseline log | Sets the primary operational baseline. |
| Attended close rate, average ticket, gross margin | POS / invoices / owner financial record | Translates attendance into economic value. |
| Ad spend and cost per lead | Ad platform | Sets the acquisition comparator. |
| Financed share | Approved provider merchant reporting | Tests whether financing-interest capture merits scope. |
| Capacity and staffed hours | Owner schedule | Defines slots and maximum useful demand. |
| Mobile traffic share | Platform breakdown / site analytics | Tests the mobile-first assumption. |
| Infrastructure and messaging cost | Current provider pricing + actual usage | Enables cost per booking and attended visit. |

Before setting pilot length, calculate the minimum sample needed for the intended show-up-rate change using the observed baseline rate, desired detectable effect, significance level, and power. If expected volume cannot support that sample, the pilot must not promise a statistically proven percentage lift. Its stated objective becomes operational feasibility, adoption, failure discovery, and directional economic evidence.

### 8.3.1 Required sample — worked estimate

The table below shows the eligible confirmed appointments required per comparison group to detect a change in show-up rate, at 95% confidence and 80% power, two-sided, assuming a 60% baseline. It is illustrative until the real baseline is measured.

| Improvement to detect | Baseline → target | Appointments per group | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| +10 percentage points | 60% → 70% | ~356 | ~712 |
| +15 percentage points | 60% → 75% | ~152 | ~304 |
| +20 percentage points | 60% → 80% | ~82 | ~164 |

Figures are unadjusted for interim analysis, dropout, or ineligible records; add margin for each. Source class: A, standard two-proportion calculation.

**Consequence.** If the pilot produces on the order of 20–40 appointments per month, detecting even a 20-point improvement requires roughly four to eight months of accumulated volume per group. The closed-sales improvement figure carried in the Claim Register is well beyond the reach of a short pilot at this volume.

This does not invalidate the pilot. It fixes what the pilot may claim. Unless measured baseline volume supports the table above, the stated objective is operational feasibility, owner adoption, failure discovery, and directional economics — and no percentage-improvement claim may be published, internally or externally, under any framing.

## 8.4 Stop / no-go criteria

**Stop all work — including development — if the franchise-authority read in Action 02 is not completed, or returns a prohibition on the independent site, customer-data capture, brand use, or third-party messaging.**

- Stop before live traffic if the franchise agreement or authorized brand owner prohibits the independent site, customer-data capture, or messaging use.
- Stop if a public booking cannot be proven to reach a monitored destination with correct confirmation behavior.
- Do not open Gate B without a named contracting entity, signed pilot agreement, consent review, sender/domain readiness, accepted sales source of truth, and recoverable baseline plan.
- Stop or reduce inventory scope if both merchant users cannot maintain the provisional category-level state during UAT.
- Reframe — not misstate — the pilot if projected volume cannot support the required quantitative sample.
- At Gate C, discontinue or renegotiate if the agreed incremental gross benefit does not exceed the agreed recurring system, messaging, support, and acquisition cost threshold. The numeric threshold is frozen with the baseline before launch.

# 9. Risks, Controls & Failure Modes

## 9.0 Scoring rubric

Severity, Occurrence, and Detection are scored 1–10, where 10 is worst. Detection scores the difficulty of detecting the failure before it reaches the customer or the decision — a high score means the failure is likely to go unnoticed.

| Score | Severity (S) | Occurrence (O) | Detection difficulty (D) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | Negligible; internal annoyance | Remote; not expected in pilot | Detected automatically and immediately |
| 3–4 | Minor; customer inconvenience, recoverable | Occasional; a few times per pilot | Detected by routine monitoring or review |
| 5–6 | Moderate; lost appointment or sale, correctable | Likely; recurring during pilot | Detected only by deliberate inspection |
| 7–8 | Major; consumer harm, compliance exposure, or invalidated evidence | Frequent; expected weekly | Detected only after effect, by chance or complaint |
| 9–10 | Critical; legal, privacy, or contractual exposure with lasting consequence | Near certain without control | Not detectable by current means |

**Action thresholds.** RPN ≥ 200 requires a documented control and a named gate disposition before that gate opens. RPN 100–199 requires a control or an accepted residual-risk statement. Any S ≥ 9 requires explicit disposition regardless of RPN — the severity override recorded in §9.1.

Scores are engineering estimates (source class A). Phase 0 verifies or revises Occurrence and Detection against observed conditions; Severity is not adjusted downward without written client agreement.

## 9.1 Preliminary FMEA scoring

This is a preliminary design FMEA. RPN = S × O × D. Scores are engineering estimates (A), not measured field results; Phase 0 must verify or revise them. Any S ≥ 9 requires explicit disposition regardless of RPN.

| ID / failure mode | Effect | S | O | D | RPN |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 Inventory not maintained | Misleading availability / mismatched visit | 6 | 6 | 5 | 180 |
| F2 Capacity configured incorrectly | Double booking / unavailable owner | 6 | 4 | 4 | 96 |
| F3 SMS consent or registration failure | Customer/provider/legal exposure | 9 | 4 | 5 | 180* |
| F4 Financing language inaccurate | Consumer confusion / compliance exposure | 8 | 4 | 5 | 160 |
| F5 Attribution overstated | Invalid economics / lost credibility | 7 | 6 | 6 | 252 |
| F6 Customer-data breach | Privacy harm / business liability | 10 | 3 | 7 | 210* |
| F7 TCG / client ownership ambiguity | IP, data, domain, or termination dispute | 8 | 5 | 6 | 240 |
| F8 Single-person dependency | Support interruption / knowledge loss | 7 | 6 | 7 | 294 |
| F9 Premature multi-location build | Cost and complexity before proof | 6 | 5 | 4 | 120 |
| F10 False urgency / stale claim | Customer trust and advertising risk | 7 | 4 | 5 | 140 |

\* Severity override applies.

## 9.2 Required controls and dispositions

| ID | Required control / test | Gate disposition |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Category-level default, freshness indicator, audit trail, and merchant UAT. | No Gate B if owners cannot maintain it. |
| F2 | Capacity rules, blackouts, conflict tests, and explicit rescheduling. | Section 6 F-04 must pass. |
| F3 | Reviewed affirmative consent, sender registration, STOP/help, templates, and callbacks. | Severity override: documented approval before Gate B. |
| F4 | Use only current provider-approved terms; remove unsupported offers. | Copy approval before public traffic. |
| F5 | Tagged source, frozen definitions, baseline, sample plan, and sales reconciliation. | No quantified value claim before Gate C. |
| F6 | Least data, RLS, named users, secret scan, logs, incident/retention plan. | Severity override: S-01/S-02/P-01 pass before Gate B. |
| F7 | Written agreement covering IP, data export/deletion, domain, accounts, and termination. | Gate A remains closed until signed. |
| F8 | Runbook, backups, credential custody in a location accessible to the store, monitoring, and a named alternate contact independent of TCG. | R-01/N-01 and handoff record complete and continuity provision executed. If no alternate and no escrow, Gate B opens only against a written accepted-residual-risk statement signed by the store. |
| F9 | Enforce Gate C before productization and Gate D before corporate claims. | No multi-location feature work outside approved experiment. |
| F10 | System-backed quantities, as-of dates, claim register, and content approval. | Remove or qualify unsupported public claim. |

**F8 residual risk statement.** F8 carries the highest RPN in this register. The controls listed above reduce recoverability but do not remove the dependency: TCG is currently a single-person supplier, and the escalation path for a TCG outage routes to the same individual who constitutes the risk. The store should treat this as an accepted commercial risk of engaging a sole-practitioner supplier, priced accordingly, and should hold independent custody of its domain, provider accounts, and data export from the outset — see Section 10. This paragraph is disclosure, not mitigation.

# 10. Governance, Ownership & Commercial Structure

The prior white paper proposed that the platform developer retain the "master keys." The Composition Group LLC is the proposed legal contracting entity. Platform custody is a negotiating position, not a complete governance model. Before launch, the parties should distinguish ownership of pre-existing code, new code, store data, customer personal information, domains, messaging accounts, analytics, and derivative benchmarks.

| Asset / right | Proposed starting position | Must be agreed |
|---|---|---|
| Core application code | TCG-owned pre-existing and generalized platform components, subject to proof and agreement. | License scope, improvements, escrow/continuity, termination rights. |
| Pilot customer data | Store receives on-demand export. Default retention: appointment and contact records retained for the pilot term plus 12 months; funnel event records and notification logs retained 24 months from creation. On termination, TCG deletes all store customer data within 30 days of the export being confirmed received, subject to lawful retention obligations and to any consent or opt-out record required to be preserved. | Controller/processor roles, permitted use, format, timing, breach notice; confirmation that the default retention periods are accepted or replaced. |
| Aggregated analytics | Platform use only in de-identified and aggregated form. Minimum cohort 20 records. Retained indefinitely in aggregate form only; no retention of underlying identifiers beyond the periods above. | Re-identification prohibition, corporate visibility. |
| Client marks and content | Used only with written authorization and applicable brand requirements. | Franchise-agreement authority, approval process, post-termination removal. |
| Domain | Ownership follows written commercial intent, not who registered it first. | DNS control, transfer rights, renewal responsibility. |
| Messaging / email provider accounts | Named legal owner and accessible operational custody before Gate B. | Number ownership, registration, templates, export, shutdown. |
| Pilot compensation | Governed by separate written agreement; payable only on defined, reconciled attributed sales. | Sales source, attribution window, returns, cancellations, taxes, disputes, audit. |
| Future licensing | No broader rights or commitments implied by the local pilot. | Authority, per-location rights, fees, support, security, SLAs. |

> **COMMERCIAL RECOMMENDATION.** Use a short written pilot agreement before live customer traffic. It should define scope, pilot term, responsibilities, data processing, acceptable claims, support, cost, commercial attribution, IP, and what happens when the pilot ends.

# 11. Scale Path & Decision Gates

| Gate | Evidence required | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Gate A — Build readiness | Verified workflow, signed pilot terms, approved copy, data model, acceptance plan. | Proceed to local alpha or revise concept. |
| Gate B — Live pilot | Owners complete tasks; booking and notification tests pass; monitoring and rollback work. | Open controlled traffic or hold. |
| Gate C — Local value | Defined sample, trustworthy outcomes, owner adoption, and the numeric economic threshold frozen under Section 8.4. | Continue, refine, renegotiate, or stop by the pre-agreed rule. |
| Gate D — Product readiness | Second-tenant isolation, provisioning, support, security, export/offboarding, repeatable onboarding. | Offer to another authorized location. |
| Gate E — Corporate pitch | Verified case study, client authority map, brand approval path, commercial model, risk posture. | Seek master license, managed rollout, partnership, or acquisition discussion. |

## 11.1 Proposed milestone ownership

| Milestone | Stack / scope | Proposed owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alpha — local lab | Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase; local funnel and portal. | The Composition Group LLC, with merchant acceptance. | As-built status unverified |
| Beta — controlled local | Custom domain, verified email/SMS, measurement and reconciliation. | Joint responsibilities under pilot agreement. | Conditional on Gate A/B |
| Productization | Store settings, tenant isolation, provisioning and operating controls. | The Composition Group LLC unless contract changes. | Conditional on local proof |
| Multi-location production | Corporate governance, security, support, licensing, analytics. | To be negotiated with authorized client entity. | Not authorized / not yet designed |

## 11.2 Gatekeeper Turnover

This CDP establishes the controlled concept baseline; it does not itself authorize live customer traffic, productization, or multi-location deployment. At each gate, the package transfers to the person or group authorized to accept the next level of operational risk.

| Turnover | Receiving gatekeeper | Evidence received | Decision authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Concept → Gate A | TCG + authorized local representative | CDP baseline, as-built record, workflow decisions, requirements, open-action status | Accept alpha baseline or return for correction |
| Gate A → Gate B | Authorized local operating parties | Passed acceptance tests, merchant UAT, messaging/domain readiness, monitoring and rollback | Authorize or withhold controlled customer traffic |
| Gate B → Gate C | TCG + local decision-makers | Pilot dataset, reconciled outcomes, owner-adoption evidence, limitations and economics | Continue, refine, renegotiate, or stop |
| Gate C → Gate D | TCG / designated product owner | Local validation report, second-store requirements, security and support controls | Authorize productization testing |
| Gate D → Gate E | Authorized client corporate/licensing authority | Verified case study, repeatable architecture, commercial model, authority map and risk package | Consider broader licensing, rollout, partnership, or acquisition |

**Turnover rule.** Open actions, failed requirements, assumptions, unresolved claims, configuration identifiers, and known limitations travel with the package. A downstream gatekeeper must not infer acceptance merely because development advanced. Appendix E records the configuration being handed over; this section defines who receives it, for what decision, and with what authority.

# 13. Controlled Action Register

Timing is expressed relative to client authorization ("Day 0") because no launch date has been agreed. RK = Rob Knowles / TCG. GS = the store operators or the authorized local store representative. "Joint" requires both sides. Calendar dates replace these relative targets at kickoff.

| ID / owner | Target | Action / done evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 01 / RK | Immediate | Verify all public routes and booking destinations. Disable or relabel any non-operational live form; retain test evidence. |
| 02 / GS + counsel | Before any further build work | Obtain a legal read of the franchise agreement covering: authority to operate an independent site, capture and process customer data, use client marks and colors, send third-party transactional messaging under the brand, and register a domain. Written summary of permissions and restrictions returned to the file. A negative finding on any item stops the project under §8.4. |
| 03 / RK | Day 0–1 | Complete as-built control: repo, commit, URLs, schema, provider accounts, route, languages, and Section 6 pass/fail. |
| 04 / GS + RK | Day 0–3 | Pull historical lead, response, booking, show, sale, financing, capacity, traffic, ad, and cost inputs; open baseline log. |
| 05 / Joint | By Day 3 | Hold 60–90 minute Phase 0 session; freeze inventory granularity, calendar rules, sales source, bilingual scope, and consumer claims. |
| 06 / Joint | By Day 5 | Name legal counterparties and sign pilot agreement covering data/IP, export/deletion, domain, costs, support, attribution, and exit. |
| 07 / RK | By Day 5 | Freeze metric dictionary, event taxonomy, baseline definitions, required sample, pilot objective, and numeric Gate C threshold. |
| 08 / RK | Before Gate B | Complete verified domain/DNS, applicable sender registration, consent/template review, STOP/help, callbacks, and failure fallback. |
| 09 / RK + GS | Before traffic | Pass Section 6 and mobile UAT; both merchant users complete inventory, blackout, booking, failure, and outcome tasks unaided. |
| 10 / Joint | Agreed pilot window | Run controlled traffic; review weekly; change one tested variable at a time. |
| 11 / RK + GS | Within 5 business days after pilot | Issue pilot validation report with sample, limitations, economics, owner adoption, and Gate C decision. |
| 12 / RK | Only after Gate C | Run second-store isolation/provisioning test; no multi-location claim before Gate D. |
| 13 / Joint | Only after Gate D | Prepare authority-specific corporate case, commercial options, and security/operations package. |

> **IMMEDIATE NEXT DECISION.** The next valuable artifact is not another platform feature. It is a signed local pilot baseline: verified workflow, accepted requirements, data definitions, and a date-bounded validation plan.
